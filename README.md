This repo contains a bash script named “cars.sh” that will help a user maintain an inventory of old cars.
 
 The user will be presented with a menu of three options:
 *to enter a new car to the list
 *to display the list of cars
 *or to quit and exit the program
 
 -if the first is chosen
 *the user has to give the year, make and model of the car
 * the new car is then added to the My_old_cars file
 
 -if the second option is chosen
 * it displays all the cars in the list
 
 -if the third option is chosen
  *the program quits and exits
